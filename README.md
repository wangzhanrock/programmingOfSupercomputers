Programming Of Supercomputers
===========================
# parallelized the GCCG solver using MPI: superMUC, PAPI, ParaView, METIS, Score-P, Cube, Vampir.

* Sequential optimization, analysis of I/O behavior, visualization
* 3-steps parallelization: domain and data, communication model between the processes, main computation loop 
* Tuned the performance of the parallelized solver on the supercomputer using different tools
